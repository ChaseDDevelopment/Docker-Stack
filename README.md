# Docker-Stack
This is my Docker Stack on my Home Server

## I'm starting with posting my traefik configuration, and will slowly add more services in. 

### Requirements

  1. A computer (Server) running Linux. I use Ubuntu Server 20.04.1, But it's really your choice, so long as it can run the latest docker.
