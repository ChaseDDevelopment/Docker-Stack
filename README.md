## Disclaimer

  This is a guide to exposing a home server to the web. This comes with security risks, and I am not resonsible for any attacks that happen on your network. While this guide will cover some things that you can use to mitigate attacks on your server, it is not foolproof, and I highly reccomend having additional security measures in place, such as a PHYSICAL firewall. 

## Guide
